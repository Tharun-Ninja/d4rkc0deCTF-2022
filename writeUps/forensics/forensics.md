##### Challenge Description
What if you delete more data?
##### Attached Files
[photu.png](./photu.png)
##### Explanation
There is a file [photu.png](./photu.png). We have to find the flag in the photo.

![photo.png](./images/photu.png)

##### WorkFlow
Since the Challenge description talks about the data, we will try to cat the image first
```
cat photu.png
```
Lots of non-readable texts are returned.
The flag might be hidden in this so we can use the `grep` command to match a particular string
Since we know that the ctf flag starts with `d4rkc0de` we can match this string.
Note: `grep`: searches for the pattern specified by the Pattern parameter and writes each matching line to standard output.
```
cat photu.png | grep "d4rkc0de"
```

Nooo Resultss !!!! That means the flag is not here.
Now we can use the **strings** command to filter all the printable characters of the image.

```
strings photu.png
```

when we go through the text hoorayy!! we can find 2 text asking to delete that. look at the pics attached below.

![text_1](./images/leads_1.png)
![text_1](./images/leads_2.png)

```
LC_ALL=C sed 's/maybe_you_should_delete_this_text_too//' photu.png > a.png
```
```
LC_ALL=C sed 's/maybe_you_should_delete_this_text//' a.png > b.png
```
![sed.png](./images/sed.png)

**Note: Don't do the reverse since if we replace `maybe_you_should_delete_this_text` first then the substring of `maybe_you_should_delete_this_text_too` will also be matched and replaced**

Then now if you open b.png yaaayyyy!! 
we got the flag in the png file

![b.png](./images/b.png)

##### Flag
`d4rkc0de{hehehe_e4sy_fl4g_ag4iN}`
