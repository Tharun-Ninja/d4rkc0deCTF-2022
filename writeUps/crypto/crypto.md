##### Challenge Description
We've made this secure notes app for you to store your notes. Without the key for the note, you can't decrypt it. Even if you try, you'll be only met with disappointment (and some gibberish text idk). To prove how secure this is, the first thing I did was to hide my own flag. Can you get it? I bet not.
